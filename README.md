# Hello! My name is Rosie

I'm an alumna of Barrett, the Honors College at Arizona State University. I currently work in sales operation, and I aspire to one day become a product manager. I taught myself SQL a couple years ago. My newest endeavour is to learn Python.

I take pride in being a proactive learner, STEM Advocate, and strategic thinker. My free time consists of listening to podcast and audiobooks, hiking, and volunteering with civic engagement and educational organizations.

## #IAm Project for Women of Color in STEM
In 2018, Katrina Miller and I co-founded the #IAm Project for women of color to succeed in STEM as a response to the stark underrepresentation of women of color in STEM. While early exposure to STEM is important, establishing a healthy, sustainable environment is critical for the female scientists, techies, engineers, & mathematicians already here. With this in mind, we hope to pave the way for those following in our footsteps with the creation of this scholarship and mentoring network.
